# BudgetPro
Java program to gain an insight into your money flow. Categories can be added to categorise transactions. Statistiscs can be shown to get a general idea of your money flow. Transactions can be repeating, which are automatically repeated  by the system after specified intervals (every month, every 3 months, every half year or every year). 

Note: BudgetPro will not get any further updates since a web application is being developed. BudgetPro contains bugs which can stop BudgetPro from working.

The application requires a MySQL Database named mydb!
